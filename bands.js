const bands = {
    punk: 'Green Day',
    rap: 'Run DMC',

  module.exports = bands;


// * Make it so that your program takes in a parameter like 'classic' and then outputs the associated band with it. In this case Led Zeppelin.

// * If no parameter is passed then loop over and output all of them like asked above.
